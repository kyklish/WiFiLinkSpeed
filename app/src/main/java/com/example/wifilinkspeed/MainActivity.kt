/*
	Official Android documentation.

	If you need to interact with the service only while your activity is visible, you should bind
	during onStart() and unbind during onStop().

	If you want your activity to receive responses even while it is stopped in the background,
	then you can bind during onCreate() and unbind during onDestroy().

	You don't usually bind and unbind during your activity's onResume() and onPause(), because these
	callbacks occur at every lifecycle transition and you should keep the processing that occurs
	at these transitions to a minimum. Also, if multiple activities in your application bind to
	the same service and there is a transition between two of those activities, the service may be
	destroyed and recreated as the current activity unbinds (during pause) before the next one binds
	(during resume).

	When a service is unbound from all clients, the Android system destroys it (unless it was also
	started with a startService() call). As such, you don't have to manage the lifecycle of your
	service if it's purely a bound service â€” the Android system manages it for you based on whether
	it is bound to any clients.

	However, if you choose to implement the onStartCommand() callback method, then you must explicitly
	stop the service, because the service is now considered to be started. In this case, the service
	runs until the service stops itself with stopSelf() or another component calls stopService(),
	regardless of whether it is bound to any clients.

	/*
		As discussed in the Services document, you can create a service that is both started and bound.
		That is, you can start a service by calling startService(), which allows the service to run
		indefinitely, and you can also allow a client to bind to the service by calling bindService().

		If you do allow your service to be started and bound, then when the service has been started,
		the system does not destroy the service when all clients unbind. Instead, you must explicitly
		stop the service by calling stopSelf() or stopService().

		Application components (activities, services, and content providers) can bind to a service
		by calling bindService(). The Android system then calls the service's onBind() method,
		which returns an IBinder for interacting with the service.

		You can connect multiple clients to a service simultaneously. However, the system caches
		the IBinder service communication channel. In other words, the system calls the service's
		onBind() method to generate the IBinder only when the first client binds. The system then
		delivers that same IBinder to all additional clients that bind to that same service,
		without calling onBind() again.

		When the last client unbinds from the service, the system destroys the service,
		unless the service was also started by startService() or startForegroundService().

		The service and client must be in the same application so that the client can cast
		the returned object and properly call its APIs. The service and client must also be in
		the same process, because this technique does not perform any marshaling across processes.

		If your client is still bound to a service when your app destroys the client, destruction
		causes the client to unbind.
